    <h1>List of Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Austin - Attended University of Texas</li>
        <li>Olympia - Worked for the State Government</li>
        <li>Dallas - Started a new job</li>
      </ul>
      I've lived in these cities for various reasons, but they all had something to offer. Austin is known for its music scene, Olympia is in a beautiful location, and Dallas has great job opportunities.
