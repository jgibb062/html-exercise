    <h1>List of Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>

        <li>Austin<span> - Attended University of Texas</span></li>
        <li>Olympia<span> - Worked for the State Government</span></li>
        <li>Dallas<span> - Started a new job</span></li>

      I've lived in these cities for various reasons, but they all had something to offer. Austin is known for its music scene, Olympia is in a beautiful location, and Dallas has great job opportunities.
